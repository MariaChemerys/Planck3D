<h2>What is Planck3D?</h2>
<b>Planck3D</b> is an iOS app that provides the 3D representation of the Planck's Law, a fundamental equation in Physics.<br>
<b>Planck's Law</b> relates the spectral radiance of a black body (an idealized object that absorbs all incoming electromagnetic radiation) to its temperature and wavelength:

Where:<br>
• B is the spectral radiance in watts per square meter per steradian per meter (W⁻²sr⁻¹m⁻¹)<br>
• λ is the wavelength in metres (m)<br>
• T is the temperature in kelvins (K)<br>
• h is Planck's constant in joule-seconds (6.626 ⋅ 10⁻³⁴ Js)<br>
• c is the speed of light in a vacuum in metres per second (3.0 ⋅ 10⁸ ms⁻¹)<br>
• k is the Boltzmann constant in joules per kelvin (1.381 ⋅ 10⁻²³ JK⁻¹)<br>
<h2>Why is Planck3D useful?</h2>
Planck3D can provide many educational benefits:<br>
• It allows users to experiment with a Planck's Law 3D model by <strong><em>changing the maximum temperature, wavelength and spectral radiance</em></strong> visible on the plot. Getting an immediate visual feedback reinforces the understanding of the relationship between these quantities.<br>
• Planck's law involves advanced concepts such as <strong><em>quantum mechanics and blackbody radiation</em></strong>. A 3D representation makes it easier to witness how these concepts interrelate.<br>
• In the app, it is possible to <strong><em>zoom in on specific regions</em></strong> of the plot and <em>rotate it</em> to examine finer details, patterns and trends that may not be apparent in a static plot. This may lead to a deeper comprehension of the underlying physics.
