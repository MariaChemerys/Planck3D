<h2>Description</h2>
<b>Planck3D</b> is an app that provides the 3D representation of the Planck's Law, a fundamental equation in Physics.<br>
<b>Planck's Law</b> relates the spectral radiance of a black body (an idealized object that absorbs all incoming electromagnetic radiation) to its temperature and wavelength:

</p>
Where:<br>
• B is the spectral radiance in watts per square meter per steradian per meter (W⁻²sr⁻¹m⁻¹)<br>
• λ is the wavelength in metres (m)<br>
• T is the temperature in kelvins (K)<br>
• h is Planck's constant in joule-seconds (6.626 ⋅ 10⁻³⁴ Js)<br>
• c is the speed of light in a vacuum in metres per second (3.0 ⋅ 10⁸ ms⁻¹)<br>
• k is the Boltzmann constant in joules per kelvin (1.381 ⋅ 10⁻²³ JK⁻¹)<br>
