<h2>What is Planck3D?</h2>
<b>Planck3D</b> is an iOS app that provides the 3D representation of the Planck's Law, a fundamental equation in Physics.<br>
<b>Planck's Law</b> relates the spectral radiance of a black body (an idealized object that absorbs all incoming electromagnetic radiation) to its temperature and wavelength:

Where:<br>
• B is the spectral radiance in watts per square meter per steradian per meter (W⁻²sr⁻¹m⁻¹)<br>
• λ is the wavelength in metres (m)<br>
• T is the temperature in kelvins (K)<br>
• h is Planck's constant in joule-seconds (6.626 ⋅ 10⁻³⁴ Js)<br>
• c is the speed of light in a vacuum in metres per second (3.0 ⋅ 10⁸ ms⁻¹)<br>
• k is the Boltzmann constant in joules per kelvin (1.381 ⋅ 10⁻²³ JK⁻¹)<br>
<h2>Why is Planck3D useful?</h2>
Planck3D can provide many educational benefits. It allows students to experiment with a Planck's Law 3D model by changing the maximum temperature, wavelength and spectral radiance visible on the plot. Getting an immediate visual feedback reinforces students' understanding of the relationship between these quantities. Planck's law involves advanced concepts such as quantum mechanics and blackbody radiation. A 3D representation makes it easier to witness how these concepts interrelate.
